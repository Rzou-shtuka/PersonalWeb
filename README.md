# Personal Webpage

This repository contains a simple static site inspired by the Purdue University Mathematics faculty pages. The layout features a branded header, left-hand navigation, and content sections for teaching, research, and student resources.

## Structure

```
index.html          # Main HTML document
assets/css/styles.css  # Global styles for layout and typography
```

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve the site with a lightweight HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.
